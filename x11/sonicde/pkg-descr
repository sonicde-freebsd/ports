The community-driven Sonic Desktop Environment aims to preserve and improve the
X11-specific aspects of KDE. It currently consists of the customized KWin/X11
sonic-win, Plasma Workspace components, the Silver theme, and some support
libraries.

x11/sonicde contains minimal Plasma Desktop and a basic set of KDE
Applications.  Additional Plasma components can be install via
x11/plasma6-plasma port.  More KDE applications can be found in the
kde-applications category:
