sonic-win is an X11 window manager and a compositing manager. Its primary usage
is in conjunction with a Desktop Shell (e.g. sonic-desktop). sonic-win is
designed to stay out of the way; users should not notice that they use a window
manager at all. Nevertheless sonic-win provides a steep learning curve for
advanced features, which are available, if they do not conflict with the
primary mission. sonic-win does not have a dedicated targeted user group, but
follows the targeted user group of the Desktop Shell using sonic-win as it's
window manager.
